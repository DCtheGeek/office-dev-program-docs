Step 1 - Join the Microsoft Office 365 Developer Program
Visit the Office 365 Dev Center and join the Microsoft Office 365 Developer Program at the following address:

https://dev.office.com/devprogram Jump


Click on ‘Join Now’ from the main page and fill out the Office Developer Program online form.  The form asks for a name, company, an email address and some other basic details. Submit the form, the author had to try this a number of times before this was accepted.   Signing into a Microsoft Account may or may not be required, the author ended up signing in first.

When successful a “Thank you – You successfully subscribed to the Microsoft Office Developer Program.  

Step 2 – Redeem free subscription for an Office 365 Developer tenant
You can get a free 30-day trial automatically. If you would like a longer trial, please email O365Dev@microsoft.com with your development scenario and a promo code will be sent to you. 

Please note that Microsoft recommends using the InPrivate, Incognito or Private Browsing features depending on the browser being used, to redeem the code. And, you cannot use the code to extend an existing subscription, either trial or paid.

Step 3 – Sign up for Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer Trial
Now an Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer Trial online form is displayed.  Supply the relevant details, including the region, contact details on the first page. 

Moving on to the next section, the most important step is to provide a user name and a chosen .onmicrosoft.com domain.   A message will be displayed if the domain is already in use. A password is also required.  Click on ‘Create my account’. This account becomes the Global Admin for the tenant.

 

Note: Don’t’ forget this username and password, write it down somewhere!  The User ID will be sent in an email as well with the subject “Welcome to your Microsoft Office 365 Trial”.

Next, a verification step is required, either using a text or a phone call to “Prove You’re Not a Robot”.  After this step, the author received an error.  Simply visiting the Office 365 admin portal Jump  got this back on track.

Step 4 – Configure the Office 365 tenant
If not opened automatically, open the setup page.  On the front of the admin page, there should be a Go to setup link to bring this up.   

 

The Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer setup screen is then shown, with three stages 1) Personalize sign-in 2) Add users 3) Get apps.  Configure this as required.

 

Step 5 - Assign licences
Assign the Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer licences to the account that was created in step 3 plus for any additional users created since.  There are five licences available in total.

This is done from the admin portal in the Active users section listed under the Users section. Pick the user and edit the Product licences assigning the E3 Developer licence.

Step 6 – Provision Office 365 services
This final stage is simply waiting while all the backend services are spun up and provisioned for the tenant, like SharePoint and Exchange.  This can take some time. During this step, some of the icons in the app launcher and home page will be shown as "Setting up (This app is still being set up)" and unavailable until completed. This shouldn’t take much longer than an hour at most to complete.

Step 7 – Enjoy the free Office 365 Developer Subscription
At the end of this process, the brand new Office 365 tenant can be used for development and testing. The trial will expire after a year.

 

A suggested next step is to enable First Release, this is ideal for receiving the latest Office 365 features as soon as possible and is explained further here - Set up the Standard or First Release options in Office 365 Jump .
