# Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription renewal and expiration

Your Microsoft 365 Developer Program membership includes a free Office 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription. Your developer subscription is renewable based on your development activity. Inactive subscriptions will eventually expire and will be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete your subscription, it will immediately expire and will be permanently deleted after 90 days. Deleted subscriptions will appear as inactive on your dashboard.

If you're an active developer, your subscription will be renewed automatically for another 90 days from the original date of expiration. 

If your subscription is inactive, you'll see the following warning on your dashboard.

When your subscription expires, you'll see the following warning text.
